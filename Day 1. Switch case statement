Problem statement
Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.
Switch-case is one of the ways to implement them.
In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices of things to do (the menu) and then is asked to select a menu item.
There are 2 choices in the menu:
Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.
You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'.
If ‘ch’ is 1, ‘a’ contains a single number ‘r’. If ‘ch’ is 2, ‘a’ contains 2 numbers, ‘l’ and ‘b’.
Consider the choice and print the appropriate area.

Example :
Input: ‘ch’ = 2 and ‘a’ = [3, 2]
Output: area = 6
Explanation: Since the choice ‘ch’ is 2, we have to print the area of the rectangle having ‘l’ = 3 and ‘b’ = 2, which is 6.


SOLUTION:
double areaSwitchCase(int ch, vector<double> a) {
	// Write your code here
	switch(ch){
		case 1:
		return M_PI * a[0]* a[0];
		case 2:
		return a[0]*a[1];
	}
}
